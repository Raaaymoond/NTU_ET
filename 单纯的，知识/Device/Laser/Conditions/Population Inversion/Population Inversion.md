- (a) Homojunction laser and double-heterojunction (DH) laser. ^103958
- (b) Energy band diagrams under forward bias for the two lasers.


To enhance stimulated emission for laser operation, population inversion is necessary. This can be done by very heavily doping both sides of the junction.

- When a large bias is applied, high concentrations of electron and holes are injected into the transition region. As a result, the region d contains a large concentration of elections in the conduction band and holes in the valance band.
  当施加大偏置电压时，高浓度的电子和空穴被注入到过渡区。因此，区域$d$包含大量导带电子和价带空穴。
- The condition necessary for population inversion is the difference of the [[Quasi-Fermi Levels]] of electron and holes $(E_{FC}-E_{FV})>E_g$.
