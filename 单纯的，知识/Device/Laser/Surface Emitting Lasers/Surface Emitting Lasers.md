- The edging emitting lasers ([[Double-Heterojunction (DH) Laser|DH Laser]] and [[Quantum-Well Lasers#Multiple Quantum-Well (MQW) Lasers|MQW Lasers]]) can have high quality. However, as the light is emitted from the edge, there are difficulties to integrate them with other devices in the real application circuits.
  边缘发射激光器（包括上述的DH激光器和QW激光器）可能有高质量。然而，由于光从边缘发射，在实际电路应用中将它们与其他设备集成时存在困难。
- Surface emitting lasers emit photons from surface.
- The structures of the surface emitting lasers also **include a QW or a few QWs as an active region**. In addition, there are n-type and p-type **distributed Bragg Reflectors (DBRs)** to better confine the generated photons.
  表面发射激光器的结构也包括作为有源区的一个量子阱或几个量子阱。此外，还有n型和p型分布式布拉格反射器 (DBRs) 以更好地限制生成的光子。
- They are called vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) as they have a vertical cavity.
  它们被称为垂直腔面发射激光器 (VCSELs)，因为它们的谐振腔是垂直的。

- Main advantage of VCSELs:
	- Small threshold current
	- Small power consumption
	- Easy for integrating with other devices.
