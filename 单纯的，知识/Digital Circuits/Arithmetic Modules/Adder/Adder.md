- Addition is most commonly used arithmetic operation
- It is often the speed-limiting element too
- Optimization of adder is very important
- Optimization can be at logic or circuit level
- Logic level optimization tries to rearrange Boolean equations so that a faster and/or smaller circuit is achieved
- Circuit optimization manipulates transistor sizes & circuit topology to optimize the speed
