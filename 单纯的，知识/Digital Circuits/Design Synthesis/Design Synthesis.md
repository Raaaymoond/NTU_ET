Design Synthesis can be defined as the transformation between two different design views (abstracts)

Typically it is a transformation from a behavioural specification into a structural description

Three kinds of synthesis are discussed:
- [[Circuit Synthesis]]
- Logic Synthesis
- Architectural Synthesis (High Level Synthesis)
