- Intermediate values have to be stored for the next operation
- The tasks of register allocation is to assign the values to registers aiming at minimizing the number of registers and interconnections
- Values that do not exist at the same period can share a single register
- Well-known register allocation algorithm includes [[Left-Edge Algorithm]] and Clique Partitioning Technique
