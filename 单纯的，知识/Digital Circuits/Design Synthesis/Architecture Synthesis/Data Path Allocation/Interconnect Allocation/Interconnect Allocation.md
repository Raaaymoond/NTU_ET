- The interconnect allocation is highly influenced by the register allocation and module allocation stage as well as the connection styles in the architecture
- Connection styles can be:
	- **Point-to-point**: registers and functional modules are directly connected with wires and multiplexers
	- **Bus**: wire connections are collected to form buses
	- **Mixture of the above two styles**
