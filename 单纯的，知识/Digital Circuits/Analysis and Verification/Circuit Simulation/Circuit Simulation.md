- Circuits are represented at transistor level
- Transistor Models are required to describe their nonlinear voltage and current characteristics
- Simulation accuracy depends on the quality and complexity of the models
- Resulting Voltage and Current Signals are represented as continuous waveforms
- Accurate but complex and timing consuming
- Impractical for large circuits
