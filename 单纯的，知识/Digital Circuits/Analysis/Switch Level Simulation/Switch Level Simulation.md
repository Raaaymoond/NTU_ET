![[Switch Level Simulation.png#pic_center|CMOS Inverter Switch-Level Model]]

- Transistors are represented with switch-level models
- Nonlinear characteristics are approximated with linear resistance
- In Off Mode, resistance is infinity
- In On Mode, average on-resistance is used
- Resulting network is a time-variant, linear network of resistors and capacitors
- Less complex and accurate
