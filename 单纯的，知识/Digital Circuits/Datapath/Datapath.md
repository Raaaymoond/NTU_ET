- Datapath is the core of the system
- All computations are performed in the datapath
- A typical datapath consists of an [[Interconnect|Interconnection]] of basic combinational functions such as logic gates (NAND, XOR, etc.) and arithmetic modules ([[Full Adder|adders]], [[Array Multiplier|multipliers]], etc.)
- Results from the datapath are stored in [[Memory]]
- [[Control Unit]]s determines the sequence of executions in the data path
- Intermediate results are stored in [[Memory#^78cfb0|registers]]
