- Usually, the parameters of the binary materials are known. The parameters of the ternaries and quaternaries can be derived using Vegard’s Law. (In 1921 by Lars Vegard, a Norwegian physicist)
- For a **ternary compound $A_xB_{1-x}C$** (where $A$ and $B$ are the same group elements (group III or group V elements), the parameter $P$, which may be **bandgap** $E_g$ or **lattice constant** (*LC*), can be expressed as $$P\left(A_xB_{1-x}C\right)=xP_{AC}+\left(1-x\right)P_{BC}$$

# Ternary Compound

- For a **ternary compound** $A_xB_{1-x}C$ (where $A$ and $B$ are the same group elements (group III or group V elements), the parameter $P$, which may be **bandgap** $E_g$ or [[Lattice Constant]] ($LC$), can be expressed as $$P(A_xB_{1-x}C)=xP_{AC}+(1-x)P_{BC}$$ where $x$ is **mole fraction** or composition which can vary from 0 to 1. ^648b21

# Quaternary Compound

- For a **quaternary compound** $A_xB_{1-x}C_yD_{1-y}$ (where $A$ and $B$ are the same group of elements, and $C$ and $D$ are the same group of elements), the parameter $P$ can beobtained from the respective values of the four binaries. $$P\left(A_xB_{1-x}C_yD_{1-y}\right)=xyP_{AC}+x(1-y)P_{AD}+(1-x)yP_{BC}+(1-x)(1-y)P_{BD}$$

# Ternary Alloys

- If the parameters of the ternary alloys $A_xB_{1-x}C$, $A_xB_{1-x}D$, $AC_yD_{1-y}$, and $BC_yD_{1-y}$ are available, then parameter P can be modified as $$P(A_xB_{1-x}C_yD_{1-y})=\frac{x(1-x)[(1-y)P_{ABD}+yP_{ABC}]}{x(1-x)+y(1-y)}+\frac{y(1-y)[xP_{ACD}+(1-x)P_{BCD}]}{x(1-x)+y(1-y)}$$
