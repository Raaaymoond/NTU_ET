- A heterojunction is defined as a junction (structure) formed by two different semiconductor materials.
- Such semiconductors are mostly alloy (compound) semiconductors
- Examples:
	- $\mathrm{Si Ge_{1-x}}$ on $\mathrm{Si}$
	- $\mathrm{Al_x Ga_{1-x} As}$ on $\mathrm{GaAs}$
	- $\mathrm{Ga_x In_{1-x} As}$ on $\mathrm{Al_x Ga_{1-x} As}$
	- etc.
