- If the growing $SiGe$ film is **thick** enough, the heterostructure will be **unstrained**.
- In this case, the grown film and the substrate have their own bulk lattice constants.
- The two materials, $SiGe$ film and Si substrate have cubic symmetry. That is, the cubic unit cell $a_f\cdot a_f\cdot a_f$ is for the film and $a_s\cdot a_s\cdot a_s$ is for the substrate.

- In this case, the atoms of the film and the substrate do **NOT** have a one-to-one correspondence at the interface. 
- This results in the formation of defects at the interface of the two materials, called **misfit dislocations**.
