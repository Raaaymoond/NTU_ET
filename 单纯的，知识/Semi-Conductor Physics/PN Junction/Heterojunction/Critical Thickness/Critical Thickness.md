- There is a critical thickness $h_c$ below which the film grown is strained without misfit dislocation (*pseudomorphic growth*), and above which the film becomes unstrained or relaxed, associated with formation of misfit dislocations at the interface. $$h_c=\frac{b}{8\pi(1+v)M}\left[ln\left(\frac{h_c}{b}\right)+1\right]$$
- where $b=\frac{b}{\sqrt{2}}$ for most (100) semiconductor systems (a is [[Lattice Constant]] of substrate), $v$ is [Poisson' ratio]([泊松系数_百度百科](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%B3%8A%E6%9D%BE%E7%B3%BB%E6%95%B0/9914992?fr=ge_ala)) with an approximate value of 0.274, $M$ is the [[Strained Heterostructure#^5aff88|mismatch]].
