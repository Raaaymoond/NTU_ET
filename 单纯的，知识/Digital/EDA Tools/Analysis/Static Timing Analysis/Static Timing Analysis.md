- Static Timing Analysis Calculates:
	- **Entry Delay**: Paths that start at an input point and end on the data input of a sequential logic cell (e.g. D input of a D flip-flop)
	- **Stage Delay**: Paths that start at a clock input of a sequential logic cell and end at the data input of another sequential logic cell
	- **Exit Delay**: Paths that start at a sequential logic cell output and end at an output point
