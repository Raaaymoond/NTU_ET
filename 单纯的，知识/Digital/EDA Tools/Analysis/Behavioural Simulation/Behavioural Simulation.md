- Difference between functional and behavioural description:
	- **Functional**: represents the intended hardware structure, i.e. blocks that connected together
	- **Behavioural**: describes only the input-output functionality
- Timing is ignored and Clock cycle is used (e.g. simulating the instruction set of a $\mathrm{\mu P}$)
- VHDL and Verilog can be used for behavioural description and simulation
- Outputs can be logic or numerical values
