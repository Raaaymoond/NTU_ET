- Extension of [[CC Lecture Slides#Logic Simulation|Logic Simulation]]
- Circuit can contain elements of arbitrary complexity, e.g. AND gate, Registers, Multiplier, RAM
- Functionality of each element can be described using HDL (VHDL or Verilog)
- The output results are logic signals
- Usually zero delay model is used to speed up the simulation
