- Combinatorial Shifters are very useful for arithmetic operations as shifting is equivalent to multiplication by powers of two
- Shift registers is simple but it shifts only 1 bit each clock cycle and not suitable for shifting several bits in one cycle
- Simple shift with fixed direction and number of bits can be implemented easily by hardware rewiring
