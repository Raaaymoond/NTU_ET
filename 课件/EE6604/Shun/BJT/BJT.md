# n-p-n Bipolar Transistors

- Device regions
	1. Emitter ($n^+$)
	2. Base ($p$)
	3. Collector ($n$)+Subcollector ($n^+$)

- Emitter is the most heavily doped and the smallest region. The subcollector is simply a low resistance path for the collector current.

# Basic Operation of Bipolar Transistor

1. Two p-n junctions back-to-back, very close (thin base).
2. When forward bias voltage is applied to the base emitter junction, the conduction band energy barrier for electrons inthe emitter is reduced
3. Electrons (minority carriers in p-Si) surmount barrier and cross the base by **diffusion** and/or **drift**.
4. Electrons reaching the collector-base junction are swept into the collector by a high field and provide the output current.
5. Holes are injected from the base into the emitter. **Excess electrons in base may recombine with holes; in order to maintain neutrality, holes must flow into base and a base current is observed.**
6. In a well-fabricated bipolar transistor, the collector current changes significantly when the base current (or equivalently the emitter-base voltage) changes only by a little. This property is known as **amplification**.


# Base Width Effect

If $\mathrm{base\ width \gg minority\ carrier\ diffusion\ length}$, device is just two independent p-n junctions. No transistor effect.
