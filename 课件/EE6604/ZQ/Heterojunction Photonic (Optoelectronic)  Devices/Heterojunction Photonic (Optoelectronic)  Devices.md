## Photon-electron Interaction

There are three processes for interaction between a photon and an electron in a solid:
- absorption
- spontaneous emission
- stimulated emission

### Absorption

If an atom in state $E_1$ absorbs the photon, it goes to the excited state $E_2$. The change in the energy state is the absorption process.

### Spontaneous Emission



### Stimulates Emission
